# Spring MVC

The _Spring MVC_ follows the _MVC design pattern_, which separates the application into three main components: the _model_, the _view_, and the _controller_.

**Model**
the _model_ is an object that holds the data that will be displayed in the view. The _model_ is typically used to store data that comes from a database, a service, or some other source of data. The _model_ is then passed to the view, which uses the data in the model to generate the HTML, JSON or other output that is sent to the client.

**View**
The _view_ is responsible for rendering the user interface of the application. It presents the data from the model to the user , and it provides a way for the user to interact with the application. The view can be implemented using different technologies, such as `JSP`, `Thymeleaf`.

**Controller**
the _controller_ is the central component of the architecture. It is responsible for handling incoming requests from clients and returning the appropriate response. The _controller_ contains methods, which are typically simple methods that are executed in response to incoming requests to return a view name. In _Spring MVC_, controller methods are mapped to specific URLs and HTTP methods, so that when a request is received from a client, the appropriate controller method is called to handle the request. The view name returned by the controller method is then used to render the response to the client.

## MVC Workflow

When a client sends an HTTP request to the server side, the web container (such as _Tomcat_) receives the request and processes it.

>**What is a web container ?**
>	A web container maintains the life cycle of _servlets_. If you are not coming from the _JEE_ world, a _Servlet_ is just a simple class that can handle _HTTP_ requests. Our `DispatcherServlet` is still a simple _Servlet_, and we will use a web container to maintain its life cycle.

*The web container, such as Tomcat, passed the http request to the `DispatcherServlet` for further processing.*

1. Dispatcher Servlet (sometimes called Front controller ) takes and traps the request & applies the **Common System Services** like Security, Logging, and Auditing.
2. Dispatcher Servlet delegates the request to **Handler Mapping.**
3. Once handler mapping gets the request maps the request with **Handler Class/Controller class** and returns the **Handler Class Bean Id**. Now dispatcher servlet receives the bean id and somehow gets the handler class object and calls method of that object so that control goes to handler class.
4. Handler class/Controller class creates command class object and perform request wrapping .i.e. receives the form data and stores (also called request wrapping) into **Command Class** object. Actually command class is java bean whose object holds received the form data.( if there is form data).
5. Now handler class **executes its own business logic** or talks with **Service or DAO** class get the output by processing the request.
6. Now handler class returns **Logical View Name** to dispatcher servlet.
7. Now dispatcher servlet take the Logical view name and returns **View Interface Implementation Class Object** having **Physical View** .it means dispatcher servlet uses **View Resolver** to get **View Object** having view layer technology and resource.
8. Dispatcher servlet calls `Render()` method on that object.
9. Now `Render()` method , transfer the control to **View Resource** for getting physical view like JSP, html etc.
10. JSP contains the presentation logic and format the result and send formatted result to browser as response.
