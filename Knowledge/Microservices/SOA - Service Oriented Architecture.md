**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** is a software design approach where an application is built as a collection of **loosely coupled, reusable services** that communicate with each other over a network. Each service represents a specific business function, such as payment processing, customer management, or order handling, and exposes its functionality through well-defined **service contracts**, typically using protocols like **SOAP** or **REST**.

In SOA, services are designed to be **independent and reusable** across multiple applications, often coordinated through a central component such as an **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**. The ESB handles tasks like message routing, transformation, security, and orchestration, allowing different services to work together smoothly. This architecture promotes **standardization, interoperability, and reuse**, especially in large enterprise systems.

However, SOA services are usually **coarser-grained**, centrally governed, and tightly managed compared to microservices. While SOA improves integration and reuse, it can become complex and less flexible due to heavy infrastructure and centralized control. This is why modern systems often evolve from SOA to **microservices architecture**, which emphasizes lighter protocols, decentralized governance, and independent deployment.
