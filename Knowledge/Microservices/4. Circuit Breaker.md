Circuit Breaker design pattern is a technique used in software development to handle service failures and improve the resilience of applications, particularly in architectures like Microservices. It acts like a physical circuit breaker, automatically stopping the flow of requests to a service that is experiencing frequent failures.

Here’s how it works! The Circuit Breaker maintains three states **Closed State**, **Open State** and **Half Open State**.

**Closed State :** Initially, the circuit is closed state, allowing normal requests to flow through to the backend microservices. The Circuit Breaker monitors the success and failure rates of requests to the backend microservice. If a certain number of consecutive failures occur (configurable threshold), the Circuit Breaker trips and transitions to the **Open state**.

**Open State :** In the Open state, all incoming requests are immediately rejected by the Circuit Breaker, preventing further strain on the failing microservice. This allows the backend service to take time to recover. The Open state lasts for a specific duration (timeout period).

**Half-Open State :** After the timeout period in the Open state, the Circuit Breaker enters the Half-Open state. It allows a single request to pass through to the backend service. If the single request in the Half-Open state succeeds, the Circuit Breaker resets to the **Closed state**, allowing normal traffic flow again. However, if the single request fails, the Circuit Breaker transitions back to the **Open state** and starts the timeout countdown again.

***Hystrix***
**Hystrix** is an open-source Java library created by **Netflix** that provides an implementation of the **Circuit Breaker** pattern to handle faults tolerance and latency in distributed systems and microservices architectures.
