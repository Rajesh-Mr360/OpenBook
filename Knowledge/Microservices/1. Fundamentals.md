# Monolithic Applications

Before Microservices was introduced, applications were built using traditional monolithic architectures where all the components of a application are tightly coupled and built as a single unit. Components such as the UI, business logic, and database handling are closely integrated, and the application is deployed as one package. However, this approach has some drawbacks: you cannot scale an individual component — you must scale and redeploy the entire application.

# Microservices

Microservices are a software architectural style in which a large application is divided into small, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others through well-defined APIs. Each service within a Microservices architecture can be independently deployed. This means that when it's time to release a new feature or upgrade a specific functionality in your software, you don't need to redeploy the entire application. Instead, you can deploy only the service(s) that have been modified. Each service can use its own technology stack, programming language, and database, which can be more efficient and cost-effective for specific components. Microservices allow for individual components of an application to be scaled independently based on demand.
