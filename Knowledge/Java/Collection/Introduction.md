The **Collections in Java** is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects. Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

The `Collection` Interface is the root or the foundation on which the Collections Framework is built. `List` , `Queue` and `Set` are the classes that extend the Collection Interface.
