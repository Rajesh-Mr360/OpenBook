# Introduction

The **Singleton design pattern** is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to it. In Java, this is achieved by declaring the class constructor as **private**, preventing external object creation, and offering a **public static method** that always returns the same single instance. This pattern is commonly used for managing shared resources such as database connections, configuration settings, or cache managers.
