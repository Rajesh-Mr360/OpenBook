Here's a breakdown of the different `GenerationType` options you can use with the `@GeneratedValue` annotation in JPA:
- `GenerationType.IDENTITY`: This strategy instructs Hibernate to rely on the **database's native auto-increment mechanism** for generating primary key values for your entities.
- **`GenerationType.AUTO`:** This is the default strategy and **lets the persistence provider choose an appropriate strategy**. In most cases with auto-incrementing columns in databases like MySQL, it would also choose `IDENTITY`. However, it's less explicit.
- **`GenerationType.SEQUENCE`:** This strategy uses a **separate database sequence table** to generate unique identifiers. It's typically used when you don't have a native auto-increment column or need more control over identifier generation across the application.
- **`GenerationType.TABLE`:** Similar to `SEQUENCE`, this strategy uses a separate table to generate identifiers. However, it's generally less common and might have some performance overhead.
