Language Fundamentals
 OOP concepts & design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
 Exceptions & custom exceptions
 Generics, Functional Interfaces, Lambda expressions
 Streams API — map, filter, reduce, collectors
Collections & Internals
Be able to answer how they work

 ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, HashSet, ConcurrentHashMap
 internal workings of HashMap
 fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators
 Big-O complexity of operations
Concurrency
Most 4+ year interviews test this

 Threads, ExecutorService, ThreadPool
 synchronized, volatile, locks, atomic variables
 Concurrency utilities: CountDownLatch, Semaphore, CyclicBarrier
 CompletableFuture & parallel streams
 immutability & thread safety
🧠 2️⃣ System Design Basics
Mid-level roles expect high-level design

 monolith vs microservices
 stateless services
 caching strategies (Redis, in-memory caching)
 load balancing, service registry, API gateway
 rate limiting, throttling, circuit breaker (Resilience4j)
Spring & Spring Boot (Advanced Concepts)
Spring Core
Bean scopes, lifecycle, @Autowire, @Qualifier
AOP concepts: join points, aspects, pointcuts
Spring Boot
Actuators, auto-configuration
Profiles, configuration properties
Scheduling (@Scheduled), async (@Async)
distributed transactions & sagas (basics)
Spring Data + JPA/Hibernate
JPQL, Criteria, pagination
Entity states: transient, detached, persistent
1-1, 1-many, many-many
Eager vs lazy loading
N+1 query problem & resolving it
caching in Hibernate (1st & 2nd level)
🌐 4️⃣ Microservices
Service communication (REST, messaging)
API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
Configuration management (Config Server)
Observability: Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana
Kafka messaging patterns:
consumer groups, partitions, offsets
exactly-once, at-least-once delivery
Kafka Streams basics
🧩 8️⃣ Problem Solving / DSA
They don’t expect competitive programming, but you must solve:

arrays, strings, maps, recursion
sliding window, two pointers
stack/queue usage
simple tree & graph logic
Platforms: LeetCode Easy-Medium / HackerRank
how synchronized internally works
